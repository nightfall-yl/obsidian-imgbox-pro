# ImgBox Pro

> An image management toolkit for Obsidian

`ImgBox Pro` is an Obsidian desktop plugin for managing images and attachments. It combines media localization, attachment cleanup, and preview interaction enhancements in a single plugin.

## Highlights

- Image localization: download web images, handle pasted / dragged media, save base64 images
- Attachment organization: multiple save locations, link styles, timestamp naming, deduplication
- Attachment cleanup: unused images, unused attachments, and unlinked attachments in the current note folder
- Image interaction: context menu, click-to-preview, drag-to-resize, navigator highlight
- Source-note jump: image navigator or image-tab context menu supports `Go to Source Note`

## Integrated Components

This version is built on `obsidian-local-images-plus` and integrates:

- `oz-clear-unused-images-obsidian`
- `AttachFlow`

It also includes:

- top-navigation settings UI: `General / Localize / Cleanup / Preview`
- settings-page language automatically follows Obsidian's system language
- a cleanup `Ribbon` shortcut
- the command palette as the full entry point

## Common Commands

Command palette entries are intentionally kept in English.

- `Localize attachments for the current note (plugin folder)`
- `Localize attachments for the current note (Obsidian folder)`
- `Localize attachments for all your notes (plugin folder)`
- `Clear Unused Images in Vault`
- `Clear Unused Attachments in Vault`
- `Clear Unlinked Attachments in Current Note Folder (Next to Note mode)`
- `Delete Current Note and Its Attachments`

Notes:

- `Clear Unlinked Attachments in Current Note Folder (Next to Note mode)` is only available in "next to note" mode, and the folder pattern must end with `${notename}` and must not contain `${date}`
- the image navigator or image-tab context menu provides: `Go to Source Note`

## Ribbon

- Chinese UI: `清理未使用图片`

It triggers:

- `Clear Unused Images in Vault`
